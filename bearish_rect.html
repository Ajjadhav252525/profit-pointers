    <h2>Bearish Rectangle</h2>

    <br>
    <p>The bearish rectangle pattern is a well-recognized technical chart formation that signals a potential continuation of an existing downtrend. It takes the shape of a rectangle within the price chart, defined by parallel horizontal lines representing support and resistance levels. Unlike patterns that indicate significant trend reversals, the bearish rectangle represents a temporary consolidation phase within a prevailing downtrend.
<br>
        In the bearish rectangle, the upper horizontal line serves as a resistance level, where selling pressure prevails, preventing the price from rising substantially. The lower line acts as support, indicating a level where short-term buying interest emerges, preventing the price from falling sharply.
    <br>    
        Traders often identify the bearish rectangle following a significant downward price move, which is the preceding trend. The consolidation within the rectangle reflects market indecision, typically accompanied by decreasing trading volumes. When the price eventually breaks out below the lower support line, it generates a bearish signal, suggesting that the downtrend is resuming.
        <br>
        To estimate potential price targets following the breakout, traders may measure the height of the rectangle (the vertical distance between support and resistance) and subtract it from the breakout point. As with any technical pattern, it's important to use other technical indicators, risk management strategies, and confirmation signals when trading the bearish rectangle pattern, as false breakouts can occur. This pattern can be observed on various timeframes and is valuable for traders and investors in different financial markets.
