    <h2>Descending Triangle</h2>

    <br>
    <p>The descending triangle pattern is a significant chart formation in technical analysis that typically unfolds within a downtrend. It comprises two key elements: a horizontal support level and a descending (falling) resistance trendline. This pattern suggests a potential continuation of the existing bearish trend or a reversal in the asset's price trajectory. As the pattern develops, it exhibits a distinct triangular shape, formed by lower highs that meet the unyielding horizontal support level. Traders closely monitor diminishing trading volume during the formation of the pattern, often interpreted as a sign of uncertainty in the market. <br>

        Confirmation of a descending triangle pattern comes with a strong bearish breakout, marked by a decisive candlestick close below the horizontal support level. Alternatively, a bullish breakout can occur if the price breaks above the descending resistance trendline, potentially indicating a reversal of the downtrend. To estimate price targets, traders often measure the vertical distance between the highest and lowest points of the triangle and subtract it from the breakout point for bearish scenarios or add it to the breakout point for bullish scenarios. <br>
        
        It's essential to exercise caution, as false breakouts can happen, necessitating additional technical analysis tools and risk management strategies. Descending triangles can manifest across various timeframes, making them valuable tools for traders and investors across different financial markets. <br>
