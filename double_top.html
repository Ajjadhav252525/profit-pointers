    <p> The double top pattern is a widely recognized and bearish reversal pattern in technical analysis. It typically occurs after an uptrend and signals a potential change in the market sentiment from bullish to bearish. The pattern consists of two peaks or highs that reach approximately the same price level, with a trough or valley in between, forming the shape of the letter "M."
<br>
        The first peak is part of the ongoing uptrend, representing a previous high point in the price. Following this high, the price retraces to form the trough, which is often seen as a support level. However, the crucial aspect of the double top pattern occurs when the price rallies again to retest the previous high (the second peak). If the price fails to break above the second peak and instead starts to decline, it is seen as a confirmation of the double top pattern.
    <br>    
        Traders interpret this as a signal to sell or take a bearish position, anticipating a potential reversal in the trend. The pattern's confirmation is often accompanied by increased trading volume and suggests that the buying momentum has weakened, giving way to potential selling pressure.
<br>        
        To estimate a price target for a potential downtrend, traders may measure the distance from the highest peak to the trough and subtract it from the breakdown point. It's essential to exercise caution and use additional technical indicators, such as moving averages or trendlines, along with risk management strategies when trading the double top pattern, as false signals can occur. This pattern can be observed on various timeframes and is valuable for traders and investors across different financial markets. <br></p>
