    <h2>Symmetrical Triangle</h2>

    <br>
    <p>The symmetrical triangle pattern is a prominent technical analysis formation that represents a period of market indecision and often precedes a significant price breakout. This pattern is characterized by two converging trendlines, one ascending as support and the other descending as resistance, forming a triangular shape. Unlike other patterns, the symmetrical triangle doesn't have a clear bias towards bullish or bearish outcomes and can occur in both uptrends and downtrends.
<br>
        As the price oscillates between these converging trendlines, trading volumes typically contract, indicating decreasing market volatility and a potential impending breakout. Traders closely watch for signs of a breakout, which can occur in either direction. A bullish breakout happens when the price moves above the upper trendline, suggesting a potential uptrend continuation, while a bearish breakout occurs when the price falls below the lower trendline, indicating a potential downtrend continuation.
    <br>    
        To estimate potential price targets following a breakout, traders often measure the height of the widest part of the triangle (the vertical distance between the two trendlines) and apply it to the breakout point. However, it's important to note that not all symmetrical triangles result in breakouts, and false signals can occur.
